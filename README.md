  Undergraduate Level Business Information Modeling Course SQL Assignment 

**Project Description**
1.	Students who attend a university have the option to live on campus in several different buildings. A student is comprised of their student id number, first and last name, sex, and age. In addition, if they have any living conditions that would have an effect on their living arrangement, smoking or early riser/night owl, these can be added to their profile.
2.	A collection of students can be placed into a class, which is dependent on when they begin their studies. Each class can have many or no students within it.
3.	Students with an outstanding balance on their bursar accounts will be issued an invoice. This invoice will display the total amount due and any scholarships they have available to apply to the credit.
4.	There are several buildings within the college campus that a student may be placed in. These buildings can be either on or off campus, and include certain amenities like an ATM.
5.	If students chose to reside within a residence hall, they will be assigned a room. There are different types of rooms, ranging from singles to doubles and even triples. Each room type has its own set occupancy.
6.	Each room is furnished with the essentials: wardrobes, dressers, beds, desks, etc. It is also important to keep track of the condition of these items to make sure they are being replaced when necessary.
7.	If there are any issues within a room, residents can submit work orders to facilities engineers to be fixed. These will be sorted based on their priority level to make sure everything is handled properly.
8.	The people who respond to work orders are the engineers of the campus. Their profiles are broken down into their full names and the department they are a part of.
9.	Each building has its own faculty that help run everything. These employees have their own ids along with their tiles and names on their profile.
10.	Finally, there is a third party security firm that handles certain situations and overall building security. These officers are broken down into their full names and ranks. Each building can have multiple or no security officers at any given time.
